Crisis
: Recently even prominent mainstream economists have realised that inflation is, in essence, a distributional conflict.
: Wealthy economies have high levels of production, with resource and energy use vastly exceeding sustainable boundaries, but they still **fail to meet many basic human needs**.
: The social crisis and the climate crisis can and must be solved together, increases of cost of living driven by the climate crisis are a long-term and escalating phenomenon.

Plan
: Ecological economists argue that one of the best ways to deal with this problem is to establish **universal public services**. Public services mobilise production around human needs and well-being, and can deliver strong social outcomes with lower levels of resource and energy use. It also enables a more rapid, coordinated shift to more sustainable systems.
: By decommodifying and democratising key sectors such as food, mobility and housing, we can solve the cost-of-living crisis – by directly reducing prices – and help solve the climate crisis at the same time.

Food
: From major driver of ecological breakdown to universal access to sustainable, nutritious, affordable, vegetarian foods.

Transport
: Localizing production and reducing less-necessary goods. Public transit with less energy and economic resilience.

Housing
: Single biggest budget item for most people, driven by commodification and financialisation of housing as an asset class and major driver of emissions.
: Socialising the rental sector, insulate and retrofit existing buildings.
