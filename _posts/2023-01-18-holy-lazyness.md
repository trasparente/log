Holy Lazyness
=============

> The very concept of non-existence carries with itself its own annihilation.

Take your stand as **Awareness**, welcome perceptions across the field of awareness, don't chase or touch them. It says yes to everything that arise, it's absolute positivity, everything flows freely, no resistance.

This positivity is our experience of reality, a quality of our will, its shared attribute with us. It is a fact that existence exist, in reality everything simply is, no negation, no negativity.

Non-being or non-existence is only for imagination figments that require being for its existence.

Same key for every door and in every philosophy: awareness and being are one, all its modalities or modifications are perceptions, can't be separated (wave-ocean) awareness is the substance of the perceptions.

The bodily sensations and the external sense perceptions are united or unified in our direct experience of them as being our real body and our reality, all the thoughts in demand are unified or united in consciousness and being made out of it.
