<abbr title="Green New Deal">GND</abbr> is a narrative to which numerous academic institutions and researchers support or conform obediently, bat is little more than a **disastrous shared illusion**.

Superexponential growth
: 200y ago start FF industrial age
: Today population 8x
: More than half land surface modified for agriculture
: Conseguent ecosystems displacement
: Biomass today: 60% livestock, 36% human, 4% wild species combined
: Athmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> doubled in 220y

We use the capacity (bio-productive and waste-assimilative) of 1.75 <abbr title="Earth Equivalent">EE</abbr>s.

Problems with GND üí∏
------------------------------------------------------
Fatal weaknesses in society's dominant aspirational pathway for combating <abbr title="Climate Change">CC</abbr>. Life after fossil fuels will closely resemble life before fossil fuels.

> Monroe's law is irrelevant to the physics of energy systems.

Every RE is subsidized by ‚õΩ
: Metal and materials mining
: Material transprot
: Manufacturing use high temperatures
: Transport finished products to installation sites
: Erection on site
: Deconstructed and transported to landfills or recycling

### Photovoltaic <abbr title="Photovoltaic">PV</abbr> ‚òÄÔ∏è

Manufacturing üè≠
: Temperatures 2000¬∞C
: Waste 2800t of water, 1.4t of toxic substances for 1MW of SP
: Emission 8.6t of which 95% are 1000x CO<sub>2</sub> GHG
: Films made of genotoxin Cadmium

Performance üì∂
: Efficency rate 15-20%
: Shockley-Queisser theoretical limit is 33%
: Loosing 50% efficiency with time
: Lifespan 20-30y
: Inverters replace 5-8y
: <abbr title="Dead Solar panels">DSP</abbr> cumulative <abbr title="End of Life">EOL</abbr> waste > all e-waste
: <abbr title="Energy Return on Energy Invested">EROEI</abbr> < 1.8:1

Storage üîã
: Lifespan 5-15y
: US consume 563x his existing storage capacity
: 1y Gigafactory Nevada production store 3min US demand
: 1battery kg need 50-100kg of ore
: Heavy duty truck and cranes can't use batteries

### Wind Power üå¨Ô∏è

Turbines
: Betz limit on wind turbine efficiency is 60%
: Latest <abbr title="Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generators">PMSGs</abbr> use rare <abbr title="Neodymium">Nd</abbr>, <abbr title="Praseodymium">Pr</abbr>, <abbr title="Dysprosium">Dy</abbr>, <abbr title="Terbium">Tb</abbr>
: Lot of steel (1700¬∞C) and 1.85t of CO<sub>2</sub> emission for steel ton
: Rare earth metal mined and radioactive waste ratio is 1:1
: Rare earth metal processing for turbines generates same radioactive waste than nuclear
: 1000t of concrete and rebar to fix tower
: Blades are unrecyclable
: <abbr title="Energy Return on Energy Invested">EROEI</abbr> < 3:1

### Hydropower üí¶

Dams impacts
: Water flow
: Water quality
: Sediments and nutrients transport
: Fish and widlife habitats
: Migration of aquatic species
: Recreational opportunities
: Slow, broaden and warming of rivers
: Lack of environmental standard
: Repairs needed

### Minerals ü™®

Extraction
: <abbr title="International Energy Agency">IEA</abbr> ‚Äúnet zero‚Äù requirements are 6x resources used today
: This metal production require <abbr title="Fossil Fuel">FF</abbr> combustion over 15y equal to that used from the <abbr title="Start Of Humanity">SOH</abbr>
: 10% energy consumption is extraction and processing, prone to rise
: <abbr title="Renowable Energy">RE</abbr> technologies brings ecological cost and social damage to <abbr title="Global South">GS</abbr>

### Technological Carbon Sequestration <abbr title="Technological Carbon Sequestration">TCS</abbr> ü•∑

<abbr title="Carbon Capture and Storage">CCS</abbr> and <abbr title="Direct Air Capture">DAC</abbr>
: Continued use of FF
: $600 Bn to sequester 1Gt
: Biggest planned plant sequester 1Mt/y
: Humanity emit >40Gt/y

### Liquid fuels üõ¢Ô∏è

: Account for 80% of non-electric consumption
: <abbr title="Combustion Engines">CE</abbr>s hits the Carnot efficiency limit
: Urban civilization is dependent on highway transportation for essential supplies

One Earth Living üåè
-------------------

Renowables
: RE technologies are not renowable and impossible to implement with no FFs
: Renowable enrgy sources are wood, mechanical wind/water, passive solar
: Human labor: active life, nature, less material, more mind and spirit
: Animal labor: required today >150 million horses and ranges

Consumption
: The ecological imperative is to achieve one-Earth living
: 62% Energy is wasted in inefficiency
: Pre capita energy consumption increased 9x in 170y
: More then 99% of labor is done by FFs

Population
: One billion can thrive in OEL
: Real number depend on living standard
: Global one-child fertility standard

Reshape socio-economics
: <abbr title="Global Footprint Network">GFN</abbr> state 75% overshoot
: FF budget allocated on essentials as agriculture and bulk transport
: De-commisionFF infrastructure and supply chain with renowable
: Workers retraining
: Social planning for allocation and distribuition
: Planned migration from dense centers and coastlines
: Large scale ecosystem restoration
: Unrelenting pressure on politicians

> Important achievements arise from the pursuit of the seemingly impossible
